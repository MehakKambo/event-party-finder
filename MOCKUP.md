## Brief description on how the design is relevant to the target demographic
Our target demographic consists of young adults (ages 18â€“35) who are socially active and prefer finding new events on-the-go. The design prioritizes:
- Displaying RSVPed or registered events allows users to stay organized and manage their plans effortlessly, which appeals to busy students, young professionals, and event-goers.
- Event recommendations based on location and preferences resonate with users seeking local activities or new social opportunities
